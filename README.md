#neighborhood

Sharing objects between multiple NodeJS instances over TCP.

Work in progress, detailed documentation comming soon.

##Installation

    npm install neighborhood

##Getting started

Neighborhood is collection of servers with one master server (controller) and many clients (worker). Server is sending UDP broadcasts to network so clients can easily find it and expand neighborhood. District name must match on both client and server. When connected, you can easily create remote objects on clients. Currently, only RemoteProcess is available.

###Server

```javascript
var Neighborhood = require('neighborhood').Neighborhood;
var RemoteProcess = require('neighborhood').RemoteObjects.RemoteProcess

new nbh = new Neighborhood({
	name: 'master',
	port: 7777,
	district: 'github.com',
	controller: true
});

nbh.on('online', function() {
	// neighborhood is online (server is listening for connections)
});

nbh.on('connect', function(neighbor) {
	// new neighbor is connected
	
	var process = new RemoteProcess(neighbor)
	process.on('create', function() {
		process.fork('remotescript.js')
		process.on('online', function() {
			// remote process is online
			
			process.send('message to process');
		});
		process.on('close', function(code, signal) {
			// remote process was closed
		});
		process.on('message', function(message) {
			// message from process
		});
	});
	process.on('error', function(err) {
		// error handler
	});
});

nbh.on('disconnect', function() {
	// neighbor was disconnected
});

nbh.on('error', function(err) {
	// error handler
});
```

###Worker

```javascript
var Neighborhood = require('neighborhood').Neighborhood;

new nbh = new Neighborhood({
	name: 'slave',
	district: 'github.com'
});

nbh.on('online', function() {
	// neighborhood is online (worker is connected to server)
});

nbh.on('offline', function() {
	// neighborhood is offline (worker was disconnected from server)
});

nbh.on('error', function(err) {
	// error handler
});
```
